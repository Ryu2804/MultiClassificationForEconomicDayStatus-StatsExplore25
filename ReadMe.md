## Overview

This project tackles a multi-class classification challenge to predict daily economic status across diverse global regions. The unique challenge involves handling datasets with **75% missing values (MCAR - Missing Completely At Random)** from 10 different regions spanning Europe, Asia, America, and Africa.

## üìä Problem Statement

- **Task**: Multi-class classification for economic day status prediction
- **Target**: `economic_day_status` with classes: Low, Medium, High
- **Challenge**: 75% missing data across all features
- **Regions**: 10 diverse datasets representing global economic conditions
- **Evaluation Metric**: F1-macro score

## üîß Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Data Handling**: Advanced imputation techniques for 75% MCAR data
- **Feature Engineering**: Strategic creation of economic indicators
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- **Data Integration**: Combining 10 regional datasets

### Feature Engineering Highlights

#### 1. **Temporal Features**
```python
# Lagged features for trend analysis
inflation_rate_lag_1
unemployment_rate_lag_1
exchange_rate_lag_1
business_confidence_index_lag_1
```

#### 2. **Rolling Statistics**
```python
# Moving averages for smoothing
inflation_rate_ma_7    # 7-day moving average
unemployment_rate_ma_7
exchange_rate_std_7    # Volatility measure
```

#### 3. **Economic Ratios**
```python
# Key economic indicators
exports_imports_ratio = exports_usd / imports_usd
debt_gdp_x_interest_rate = debt_gdp_ratio * interest_rate
```

#### 4. **Rate of Change Features**
```python
# Momentum indicators
inflation_rate_pct_change
exchange_rate_daily_change
biz_confidence_change
```

#### 5. **Threshold-based Binary Features**
```python
# Economic condition flags
high_inflation = (inflation_rate > 0.05)
high_unemployment = (unemployment_rate > 0.06)
```

#### 6. **Categorical Encoding**
- Trade balance status: Deficit(-1), Neutral(0), Surplus(1)
- Political stability: Unstable(-1), Moderate(0), Stable(1)
- Income group: Low(-1), Lower-Middle(0), Upper-Middle(1)

### Model Architecture

**Random Forest Classifier** with optimized hyperparameters:
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=805,
    max_depth=17,
    min_samples_split=14,
    min_samples_leaf=4,
    bootstrap=False,
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42
)
```

### Key Features Used
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP per capita, inflation rate, unemployment rate
- **Trade Metrics**: Exports, imports, trade balance status
- **Financial Data**: Interest rates, exchange rates, debt ratios
- **Social Indicators**: Education index, healthcare index, poverty rate
- **Infrastructure**: Internet penetration, urbanization percentage
- **Governance**: Political stability, governance quality

## üìà Results

- **Test F1-macro Score**: 0.4359
- **Public Leaderboard**: **Rank 1st with 0.447021 RMSE**
- **Model Performance**: Robust handling of imbalanced classes with `class_weight='balanced'`
